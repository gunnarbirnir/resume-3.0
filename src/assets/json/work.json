      "description": "I was in the Logs team at LogicMonitor, which became a part of the company after a Swedish startup was acquired. I joined shortly after the acquisition so I was able to develop and grow the product from early on. One of the things I worked on was building a new micro frontend for the logs page. The Stockholm office was closed in 2023."
